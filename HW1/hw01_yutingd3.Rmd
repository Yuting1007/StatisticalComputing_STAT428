## Exercise 4:  
**Simple R questions: ** Some of the questions below can be answered with very little or no programming. However, write code that outputs the final answer and does not require any additional paper calculations. For example, suppose I ask for how many numbers are in the vector, `x=c(1,9,2,8,10,12)`. Do not count the numbers in the vector, instead have R count by coding `length(x)`. _('c()' is a function to create vector in R; 'length()' is a function to calculate the length of a vector (refer [here](http://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html) or google).)_

R has a built-in matrix of different types of data of every US state, ``state.x77``. Use this matrix and R's built in functions and **vector calculation** to perform the following tasks.  You will also need `rownames(state.x77)` to get the state names and R's character functions to manipulate them (refer [here](http://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html) or google).

(a)  What is the longest state name (including spaces) and how long is it?
(b)  List all the states that are more then one word.  How many are there?
(c)  List  all  the  US  State names,  where  all  of  the  upper  and  lower  case  `a's`  are
replaced with a capital `Z`.
(d) Output only the second column of the matrix and store it in the numeric vector ``capita``. This vector indicates the per capita income (1974) of every US states.
(e) What is the average per-capita income of the US (1974)?
(f) What is the average per-capita income of the states that have names that are more than one word?
(g) Which state has the highest per-capita income?

## Solution 4:
(a)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
rownames(state.x77)[nchar(rownames(state.x77)) == max(nchar(rownames(state.x77)))]
max(nchar(rownames(state.x77)))
```

(b)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
state_name = rownames(state.x77)
state_name[grep(" ", state_name)]

length(state_name[grep(" ", state_name)])
```

(c)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
sub(pattern = "A|a", replacement = "Z", state_name)
```
(d)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
captita = as.numeric(state.x77[,2])

captita
```

(e)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
mean(captita)
```

(f)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
c = grep(" ", rownames(state.x77))

mean(captita[c])
```

(e)
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
state.name[state.x77[,2] == max(state.x77[,2])]

```

9. What is a statistic? Can you give two examples? 
10. What is an estimator $\theta$? Can you give two examples? 
11. What is the bias of an estimator $bias(\hat\theta)$?

14. What is the relation between $MSE(\hat\theta)$ and $bias(\hat\theta)$?
15. What do the methods of MOM and MLE help you do? You can explain it by an example. 
16. Give an application example that would require you to use one of these estimation techniques.


## Solution 5:
1. iRandom variable s a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon. 
2. There are two types of random variables, discrete and continuous
3. The probability distribution for a random variable describes how the probabilities are distributed over the values of the random variable.
4. 
a. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) will give you the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain real number.

b. Probability mass function (PMF) gives you the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some real value

c. Probability density function (PDF) of a random variable X, when integrated over a set of real numbers A, will give the probability that X lies in A.

5. 
a. $E[X]$ indicates its weighted average. Let $X$ be a random variable assuming the values x1, x2, x3, ... with corresponding
probabilities p(x1), p(x2), p(x3),..... For any function g, the mean or expected value of g(X) is defined by $E(g(X)) = sum g(xk) p(xk)$.

b. $V[X]$
If $X$ is a random variable with mean $E(X)$, then the variance of $X$, denoted by
$Var(X)$, is defined by $Var(X) = E((X-E(X))^2$.

c. mode of a random variable $X$
The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often. If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x (i.e, X = x) at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled

6. 
The examples for **discrete random variables**:
a. The result of a dice roll
The distribution function is $F(x) = 1/6, x=(0,6)$
The mean is 3.5
the variance is 3.5
b. The Bernoulli experiment with k success follows a bionomial distribution
The example will be flip a fair coin 10 times, the probility to see k heads(success), 
The distribution function 
\[
    p10(k) = \Pr\{N = k\}
           = \dbinom{10}{k} 0.5^k(1-0.5)^{10-k} \ ; \
           0 \leq k \leq 10
\]
The mean is 5
The variance is 2.5 

The examples for **continuous random variables**
a. A normal distribution(mean = 0, std = 1)
$N(0,1)$
The distribution function
\[f_X(x) = \frac {1}{\sigma _x\sqrt {2\pi}}
e^{-x^2/2\sigma _x^2}\]
where $\sigma_x^2$ is equal to 1.
mean is 0, variance is 1

b. Exponential distribution $\lambda = 1 $
$f(x)= \lambda \exp(-\lambda x)$ 
for $x \ge 0$ and $f(x)= 0$ for $x < 0$.
mean = 1, variance = 1

7.
**discrete random variable**
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# the dice roll example
prob1 <- rep(1/6, 6) 

# plot the probabilites 
plot(prob1, 
     main = "Probability Distribution of a Dice Roll",
     xlab = "outcomes") 

```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# the coin flip example
k <- 0:10

prob2 <- dbinom(x = k, size = 10, prob = 0.5)

# plot the probabilites 
plot(x = k, 
     y = prob2,
     main = "Probability Distribution of k Heads in 10 Coin Flip",
     xlab = "Number of Heads") 

```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# the normal distribution example
curve(dnorm(x),
      xlim = c(-3.5, 3.5),
      ylab = 'Density',
      main = "Standard Normal Density Function")
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# the exponential distribution example
curve(dexp(x, rate = 1),
      xlim = c(0,10),
      ylab = 'Density',
      main = "Exponential Density Function")
```

## Sampling distributions and estimation
8. A random sample is a sequence of independent, identically distributed (IID) random variables. 
The term random sample is ubiquitous in mathematical statistics while the abbreviation IID is just as common in basic probability

9. A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is any quantity computed from values in a sample. The two examples are samle mean and sample variance

10. An "estimator" or "point estimate" is a statistic (that is, a function of the data) that is used to infer the value of an unknown parameter in a statistical model.
For example, the sample mean$(x̄)$ is an estimator for the population mean, $μ$; the sample mean $(s̄)$ is an estimator for the population variance, $(\sigma)$.

11. The bias of an estimator $\hat\theta$ of a parameter $θ$ is the difference between the expected value of ˆθ and θ; that is, $Bias(\hat\theta) = E(\hat\theta)−θ$.

12. The variance of $\hat\theta$ is simply the expected value of the squared sampling deviations, that is $Var(\hat\theta) = E[(\hat\theta - E(\hat\theta))^2]$
t is used to indicate how far, on average, the collection of estimates are from the expected value of the estimates

13. The mean squared error of $ˆθ$ is defined as the expected value (probability-weighted average, over all samples) of the squared errors, that is $MSE(\hat\theta) = E[(\hat\theta-\theta)^2]$

14. MSE, mean squared error = variance + square of bias. In particular, for an unbiased estimator, the variance equals the MSE.

15. 
MOM is short for "method of Moment" and MLE is short for "Maximum Likelihood Estimation". Both methods are used to estimate the population parameters.
a. **MOM** It starts by expressing the population moments (i.e., the expected values of powers of the random variable under consideration) as functions of the parameters of interest. Those expressions are then set equal to the sample moments. The number of such equations is the same as the number of parameters to be estimated. Those equations are then solved for the parameters of interest. The solutions are estimates of those parameters
For example, the Bernoulli random variables with parameter p. The first moment about the origin is $E(X_i) = p$. We cam solve this equation to find the parameter $p$.
b. **MLE** Suppose we have a random sample whose assumed probabilty distribution depends on some unknown parameter $\theta$. Our primary goal here will be to find a point estimator $\mu$ which is a good point estimate of $\theta$.
For example, the Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p$.
in order to implement the method of maximum likelihood, we need to find the $p$ that maximizes the likelihood $L(p)$. We need to put on our calculus hats now, since in order to maximize the function, we are going to need to differentiate the likelihood function with respect to $p$. To take the derivative of $ln(L(p))$ (with respect to $p$) rather than taking the derivative of $L(p)$. Again, doing so often makes the differentiation much easier. Now, all we have to do is solve for $p$.

16. 
Suppose that $X$ is a discrete random variable with the following probability mass function: where \[0 \leq p \leq 1\]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
x <- data.frame("x" = 0:3, "f(x)" = c("2p/3", "p/3", "2(1-p)/3", "(1-p)/3"))
kable(x, caption = "The pmf of X")
```
The following 10 independent observations were taken from such distribution :{3,0,2,1,3,2,1,0,2,1}.
The theortical mean value is $7/3 - 2p$ coming from the formula $E(X)=\sum_{i=0}^{3} xP(x)$

The sample mean value is 1.5
$\hat X = {\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}$

We need to solve the equation $7/3 - 2p = 1.5$
And we finally get the method of moment estimation $\hat p = 5/12$
